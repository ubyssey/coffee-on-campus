# Where to get coffee on campus?

Everybody drinks coffee, and UBC has a coffee shop in practically every building. We want to create a tool that helps people decide where to get their fix.

**Here's how it works:**

A user fills out a series of preferences. For example:

- Cost
- Quality of coffee
- Friendliness of staff

They then get back a ranked list of coffee shops that match their preferences.

## Project tasks

1. [Compile list of all coffee shops](https://github.com/ubyssey/coffee-on-campus/issues/1)
2. [Decide on a rubric for ranking shops, create a spreadsheet, and ask friends/coworkers/classmates to rate all of the shops using the rubric](https://github.com/ubyssey/coffee-on-campus/issues/1)
3. [Build a simple interface for selecting preferences](https://github.com/ubyssey/coffee-on-campus/issues/1)
4. [Build a query engine that compares user preferences against the dataset and returns a sorted list of coffee shops](https://github.com/ubyssey/coffee-on-campus/issues/1)
5. [Build a view that displays the top 10 results from step 4](https://github.com/ubyssey/coffee-on-campus/issues/1)
